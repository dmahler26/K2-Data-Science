Data Cleaning:
- Remove all current loans
- Remove all end-of-loan values/summaries
- Treating late as default

EDA:

Classification MVP:
- loss: hinge, log, etc. How do we know which to use?
- fit_intercept: what situations call for setting true vs false
- thresholds, recalls, precisions: shape different? thresholds missing 1 value vs others?
- models taking a long time to compute. Suggested approaches? Cannot run grid/random search on certain models since even 1 iteration takes 10+ seconds. Worst case 1 minute. Just ignore those models?
