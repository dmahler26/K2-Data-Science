Log Reg:
- Poly features + Standard Scaler. Sequence important?
- Weird behavior with PR curve. Div by 0 on calculating F score.
- Recommended procedure for testing non-poly versus poly. Repeat whole procedure twice? (feature selection, PCA, etc.). Include from the start and let regularization etc. handle it?
- Extreme values for C (< 1e-6) recommended for models. Is this too much?
- Make sense to try poly features with each model?
- Sequence of feature selectio, grid search etc. e.g RFE first, then grid search, or perform RFE on optimal grid search model, or both?

SVC
- Gamma >= 1 causes extreme fitting times, even with reduced sample size (e.g. 2000)
- Normalization vs. standard scaler. Need to normalize OHE features as well? Why does it change binary feature values from [0, 1]?
- Should be no issue with scaling then normalizing?
